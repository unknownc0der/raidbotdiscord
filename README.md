RAIDBOT DISCORD PREMIUM 


Meet the tools!
Tool: are you a moderator without permissions looking to convince a server to add your favorite moderation bot? Say no more! Ironically, Anubis plays into the idea of anti-raiding. Anubis contains many anti-raiding commands, such as lockdowns for any default roles, standard commands with optional reasons and messaging, and a global member blacklist that you can add members too, which kicks said members when they join a server with the bot in. You can also define words too, just as an added bonus. Both Anubis and Qetesh contain nine hidden, malicious commands.

Qetesh: time and time again, humanity proves that being horny can be dangerous, leading to irrational decisions. With that in mind, Qetesh is arguably the star raidkit. Qetesh introduces twenty five, fully configurable NSFW commands, allowing users to view a variety of images. Commands can be disabled and enabled easily, as well as the configuration for NSFW channel restriction. Bot Anubis and Qetesh contain nine hidden, malicious commands.

Osiris: this is the project's user authentication token handler. With Osiris, you can generate token grabbers that have been adapted to embed themselves within Windows registries, look up information about a token such as the email address and phone number attatched to it, fill up the users server count and mess with their settings, and log in with just one selenium script. To use Osiris, you must include this browser folder - just put it in the same directory as main.py
